## About the Course üìö

### Target Audience üéØ

**You:** A novice in machine learning or deep learning eager to acquire PyTorch skills.

**This course:** Guides you through PyTorch and essential machine learning concepts in a practical, code-centric manner.

Even if you possess over a year of experience in machine learning, this course, designed with beginners in mind, can still provide valuable insights.

### Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

1. 3-6 months of Python coding experience.
2. Completion of at least one beginner-level machine learning course (though additional resources are linked for various topics).
3. Familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab (you can pick this up as you progress).
4. An open-minded willingness to learn (the most crucial requirement).

For items 1 & 2, consider the [Zero to Mastery Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://dbourke.link/ZTMMLcourse), covering fundamental machine learning and Python concepts (full disclosure: I teach that course too).

### Teaching Method üìù

Access all course materials for free in an online book at [learnpytorch.io](https://learnpytorch.io). If you prefer reading, explore the resources there.

For those inclined toward video learning, the course adopts an apprenticeship-style format, where I write PyTorch code, and you follow suit.

The course advocates *if in doubt, run the code* and *experiment, experiment, experiment!* as mantras, emphasizing hands-on learning.

All code is implemented using [Google Colab Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com) (Jupyter Notebooks are also suitable), offering a fantastic free environment for experimenting with machine learning.

### Course Outcomes üèÜ

Certificates are available for completing the video segments, but the real value lies in the practical experience gained.

Consider this course as a springboard for your machine learning journey. By the end, you'll have crafted extensive PyTorch code, exposed yourself to vital machine learning concepts, and built a foundation for tackling your projects or dissecting public PyTorch-based machine learning endeavors.

### Course Projects üõ†Ô∏è

Commencing with the essential PyTorch and machine learning fundamentals, the course progresses to cover advanced topics such as PyTorch neural network classification, workflows, computer vision, custom datasets, experiment tracking, model deployment, and the potent technique of transfer learning.

Throughout the journey, you'll undertake three significant projects centered around FoodVision, a comprehensive neural network computer vision model designed to classify images of food. These projects serve as milestones, reinforcing key PyTorch concepts and creating a portfolio to showcase your skills to potential employers.

### Getting Started üöÄ

While you can access the materials on any device, a desktop browser is recommended for an optimal viewing and coding experience.

The course utilizes Google Colab, a free tool. If you're unfamiliar, complete the free [Introduction to Google Colab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) before proceeding.

To commence:

1. Click on one of the notebook or section links above, like "[00. PyTorch Fundamentals](https://www.learnpytorch.io/00_pytorch_fundamentals/)".
2. Click the "Open in Colab" button at the top.
3. Press SHIFT+Enter a few times and observe the magic unfold.
